    We’ve been traditional table-top gaming for a long time and decided to try out some virtual table-tops.
    Ultimately, we found the interface cumbersome and the experience lacking. Over the years, we’d hash out
    our various issues and frustrations with the medium and realized we had some pretty great ideas of our own.
    Eventually we came to the conclusion that the only way we’d get the system that we wanted was to build it ourselves.
    And that’s what we’ve decided to do. We’re now creating Sandragon - a new way to create, share, play and relish
    TTRPGS online. Sandragon will offer robust GM tools for quicker, easier campaign planning, custom content
    creation that will let you craft, share and even sell homebrewed excellence, an advanced play-by-post
    system to keep the game alive between sessions and a custom system designed exclusively for the Sandragon platform.
    Best of all it’s free to play. Join us online at sandragon.io, follow us on (social media icons)and make sure to
    sign up for our newsletter. Let's put mediocre gaming experiences to the sword!
