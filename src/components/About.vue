      Gamers want action, they want intrigue, and maybe some bawdy innuendo now and then.
      What we don’t want is time wasted looking up rules and trouble-shooting software.
      andragon is built to maximize your playtime and minimize bog-downs.
      With 30 years of playing ttrpgs (table-top role playing games), we’ve learned about
      the pitfalls of gaming and how to avoid them through experience.

          <br>
          Everything you need to bring your game to life will be obvious and accessible.
          You don’t want to look up a tutorial wiki article any time you want to use a feature of our
          platform, and you won’t have to. No esoteric controls, no hunting for commands. A ttrpg should
          be as easy to use as a pencil, paper and dice. Sandragon is committed to that ideal.
          <br><br>
          Conversation is at the heart of the ttrpg experience. World class group forums and private
          messaging will ensure communications between GMs and players are easy, apparent and effective.
          If you have a rules-lawyer in your group (and we know you do), satisfy them fast with the in-game wiki.
          It will help keep that min-maxer in your group in-check too.

            <br>
            Like other services, you’ll be able to upload content you want. But Sandragon’s mapping system
            is so simple, creating fresh content will be a breeze. There’s no need for you to browse through scores
            of inapplicable components and images to find the ones that look right. Choose from a wide pallet of
            customizable map pieces and ‘skin’ them to any variety of themes. Save the maps you’ve created so you can use
            them again in other games or pass them on to other groups. Create custom pieces or trade for them at the marketplace
            to get that oh so perfect final touch.

            Sandragon is the only platform offering character conversions between roleplaying systems.
            Port your favorite D&D character into Gurps and play them in a new setting. Convert your Gurps
            character to fifth edition D&D and see what they look like with a class and level.
            <br><br>
            Also, Sandragon is designed to accommodate asynchronous, play-by-post gaming. Why stop when the
            game session ends? Let your players converse, peruse the shops and carouse on a turn-by-turn basis
            until your next meet. Set your timeline and handle individual player activities without wasting group time.

          Content you create in Sandragon doesn’t have to stay trapped in your game, unleash it into the world.
          Sandragon’s online marketplace will allow you to share, sell or trade anything you’ve created on the platform.
          Likewise, you may wish to peruse the exotic wares other creators have on display or purchase official Sandragon content.
